<h3>News Magazines</h3>

<h4><a href="http://femmagazine.com/">Fem</a></h4>

<p>FEM, UCLA’s feminist newsmagazine since 1973, is dedicated to the empowerment of all women, the promotion of human rights, the recognition of gender diversity, and the application of intersectional feminism. FEM celebrates women’s right to equality in all aspects of life and appeals to an audience that believes feminist ideology is still necessary to defeat sexism. We will offer a wide range of timely feature, opinion, and news pieces that tackle gender issues in relation to sexuality, race, class, and popular culture. The purpose of FEM is to enlighten our audience with information and personal accounts that may be rejected or ignored within mainstream media.</p>

<h4><a href="http://lagente.org/">La Gente</a></h4>

<p>La Gente Newsmagazine, born from the Chicana/o movement, arose out of a need to represent the Latina/o community and their issues in UCLA and the greater Los Angeles area. In an effort to be the voice of Latina/o experiences, we have featured news and opinions that highlight our communities since 1971. We continue to provide the latest on art, culture, community, and university news and events relating to our communities.</p>

<h4><a href="http://nommomagazine.com/">NOMMO</a></h4>

<p>NOMMO Newsmagazine is designed to appeal to those who have an interest in all aspects of community organizing affecting change in education, arts, and social issues that positively or negatively affect members of the Afrikan descent community.</p>

<h4><a href="http://outwritenewsmag.org">OutWrite</a></h4>

<p>OutWrite Newsmagazine is the University of California Los Angeles’ queer newsmagazine, aiming to educate on and validate the experiences and issues of all non-heteronormative identified individuals and allies of UCLA and Los Angeles, through student opinions and journalistic coverage, in a mission to expose and reverse homophobia and unite the queer community and its allies against these social injustices.</p>

<h4><a href="http://pacificties.org">Pacific Ties</a></h4>

<p>We are a web newsmagazine distributed by UCLA Student Media in Los Angeles, California. We are the oldest student-run Asian and Pacific Islander newsmagazine in the nation. Since 1977, we have brought you news, analysis, commentary, criticism, and insight into the API community.</p>

<h4><a href="http://al-talib.org/">Al-Talib</a></h4>

<p>Al-Talib Newsmagazine was established in 1990 by Muslim UCLA students, making it the first student-run Muslim publication in America.  The news magazine is part of Student Media UCLA. Staff members are all students and the writers are current students or alumni. At the height of print media, Al-Talib printed 40,000 issues four times a year and distributed en masse to over 40 states covering most major cities. However, recent shifts in technology and journalism leads the news magazine to move toward online-based publishing, with an aspiration to create a constant and relevant web presence. </p>
